= What is this? =
=================

This is a stand alone package for GLTools. According to the OpenGL SuperBible, written by the author of GLTools: 

GLTools began life in the third edition of this
book. Over time it has grown and provides a lot of shortcuts and handy tools, much like
the OpenGL utility library (GLU) used to. GLTools includes a 3D math library to manipu-
late matrices and vectors and relies on GLEW for full OpenGL 3.3 support of functions
that generate and render some simple 3D objects and manage your view frustum, camera,
and transformation matrices

GLTools is incredibly useful, however, it is a real pain to get set up under Linux. The makefiles provided with the
companion source code for the book all rebuild GLTools from scratch and statically link it to the executable. 

For this distribution, I removed the included copy of GLEW and wrote some CMake files to make it easier to use
with your own programs.

The official repository is available at http://code.google.com/p/oglsuperbible5/

NOTE: I only tested the build process under Ubuntu 10.04, if there are any issues on other platforms, patches are appreciated.
